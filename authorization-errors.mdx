All Payitoff API requests must include an HTTP `Authorization` header with a `Bearer` token, such as 

`Authorization: Bearer LIVELONGANDPROSPER`. 

The `Bearer` token is your Payitoff API Key.

If your API request neglects to provide the `Authorization` header, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP response, and the following `AuthorizationError` response body:

JSON

`{
  "error": {
    "detail": "Please include an authorization header.",
    "title": "Unauthorized"
  }
}
`

If your API request provides an `Authorization` header, but neglects to include the `Bearer` token, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP response, and the following `AuthorizationError` response body:

JSON

`{
  "error": {
    "detail": "Please include a Bearer token in your header.",
    "title": "Unauthorized"
  }
}
`

If your API request provides an `Authorization` header, but includes an invalid `Bearer` token, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP response, and the following `AuthorizationError` response body:

JSON

`{
  "error": {
    "detail": "Invalid token.  Please check and try again.",
    "title": "Unauthorized"
  }
}
