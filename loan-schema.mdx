description: "Payitoff API: Loan Schema"
---

A `Loan` object provides the details fo a single student loan for a `Borrower`.

> ❗️
> 
> Deprecated since v1.0.1 — Use `PortfolioLoan` instead.
> 
> The `Loan` object has been deprecated in favor of our richer and more detailed `PortfolioLoan` objects, which are available to you by using [Nexus](/docs/nexus) to link your `Borrowers` with their `Servicers`.

> 🚧
> 
> Use [LoanPayload](/docs/loan-payload-schema) for API `POST` requests
> 
> When creating `Loans` for `Borrowers` via the [Create Loans](/reference/create-loans) API endpoint, you must supply loan details in the shape of a [LoanPayload](/docs/loan-payload-schema).
> 
> You will receive a `Loan` object in the API response.

The total\_cost field provides the sum of total\_paid plus the taxes owed on that forgiven amount (which is calculated and provided in the estimated\_tax\_liability field). In other words, total\_cost is the bottom line amount a borrower will pay to dispense of their loan on its current Repayment Plan. |
