To get the most accurate and up-to-date loan portfolio for your `Borrower`, you should use `Nexus.link` to prompt your `Borrower` to connect all the Servicers they pay monthly. We'll do the heavy lifting of building their entire loan portfolio for you.

> ðŸš§
> 
> `Nexus.linkServicers` deprecated. Use `Nexus.link` instead.
> 
> Originally, Nexus launched with servicer account-linking offered through the `linkServicers` function. That function has now been renamed to `Nexus.link`. This isn't a breaking change at this point, as the `linkServicers` function call will still succeed. But we will remove `linkServicers` in a future update, so we encourage you to update your code to call `Nexus.link` at this time.

### Calling `Nexus.link`

`Nexus.link` expects to receive a single `options` object as a parameter. This `options` object allows you to specify two possible callbacks:

* **`onSuccess`** â€” a function to execute when the workflow completes successfully
* **`onExit`** â€” a function to execute when your borrower exits the workflow or an error occurs

Calling Nexus.link

`// Assuming you have a button your Borrower can click to link Servicers
let linkButton = document.querySelector('#nexus-link-button')

// Attach click handler to invoke Nexus.link
linkButton.addEventListener('click', e => {
  Nexus.link({
    // the function to call when borrower is done
    onSuccess: linkSuccess,
    // the function to call when borrower quits or error occurs
    onExit: linkExit
  })
})
`

`Nexus.link` asking a borrower to connect their servicer account(s).

#### `onSuccess` callback

When your `Borrower` finishes the `Nexus.link` workflowâ€”which occurs when they click the **I'm Done** button after connecting their servicer accountsâ€”Nexus will execute the unary callback function you provide to the `onSuccess` option when invoking `Nexus.link`.

Nexus.link â€” onSuccess callback

`function linkSuccess(response) {
  // maybe congratulate your borrower on linking their Servicers!
  console.log('Servicers linked')
  console.log(response)
}
`

#### `onSuccess` response

Your `onSuccess` callback function should expect a single object with additional information you can inspect. The Nexus response will contain **three** properties:

* **`message`**â€”a `string` value indicating the workflow succeeded
* **`result`** â€”an `object` that provides additional details and may change over time.  
   * `borrower`â€”an `object` that provides additional details on the borrower for whom the Nexus workflow was performed.  
         * `uuid`â€”the unique Payitoff UUID that identifies this borrower for API and Nexus calls
* **`status`**â€”a `string` value. Will always be **`"complete"`** for an `onSuccess` callback.

##### Example `onSuccess` callback response for `Nexus.link`

In the example below, you can see a user completed linking servicers and clicked the **I'm Done** button to close the widget.

Nexus.link â€” onSuccess response

`{
  message: "Link complete.",
  result: {
    borrower: {
      uuid: "9e0cc73c-d450-44ea-857a-3030d3674572"
    },
    workflow: "link"
  },
  status: "complete"
}
`

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> **If you're relying on Nexus to create borrowers for you, you will want to save the `borrower.uuid` that is returned so you can make API calls on behalf of your borrowers.**

#### `onExit` callback

When your `Borrower` exits the `Nexus.link` workflowâ€”which occurs when they cancel or otherwise dismiss Nexus without completing the `link` workflowâ€”Nexus will execute the unary callback function you provide to the `onExit` option when invoking `Nexus.link`.

Nexus.link â€” onExit callback

`function linkExit(response) {
  switch (response.status) {
    case "incomplete":
      // User quit the widget.
      // Maybe save that they quit so you can prompt them to finish later.
      break;
    case "illegal":
      // You asked to perform a workflow your borrower isn't ready for.
      break;
    case "error":
      // You supplied an invalid Nexus key and/or Borrower UUID,
      // or an error occurred in Nexus/Payitoff.
      break;
  }
}
`

#### `onExit` response

Your `onExit` callback function should expect a single object with additional information you can inspect. The Nexus response will contain **three** properties:

* **`message`** â€” a `string` indicating what occurred to trigger the exit
* **`result`** â€”an `object` that provides additional details and may change over time.  
   * `borrower`â€”an `object` that provides additional details on the borrower for whom the Nexus workflow was performed. **If you're relying on Nexus to create borrowers for you, you will want to save the `uuid` that is returned so you can make API calls on behalf of your borrowers.**  
         * `uuid`â€”the unique Payitoff UUID that identifies this borrower for API and Nexus calls  
   * `workflow`â€”an optional `string` value indicating what workflow a borrower was in when they exited Nexus, if they decided to bail out. Should always be present when `status` is `"incomplete"`.
* **`status`** â€” a `string` value that is one of the following values:  
   * `"error"` â€” Nexus received an invalid `nexus_key`, `uuid`, or encountered some other error  
   * `"illegal"` â€” You have attempted to perform an action for a borrower that is not allowed, or for which the borrower is not currently ready  
   * `"incomplete"` â€” Your borrower quit the widget without completing the requested workflow

##### Example `onExit` callback response for `Nexus.link`

In the example below, you can see a user did not complete linking servicers and chose to exit the widget.

Nexus.link â€” onExit response

`{
  message: "You didn't complete linking your servicers.",
  result: {
    borrower: {
      uuid: "9e0cc73c-d450-44ea-857a-3030d3674572"
    },
    workflow: "link"
  },
  status: "incomplete"
}

> We know it can be helpful to know if your borrower quit a workflow you'd like them to complete to keep using your products and services. To that end, we recommend you catch the `incomplete` status and inspect `result.workflow` to know when they exited. This can provide you a helpful trigger point for notifying your users to come back and otherwise prompt them to finish linking their servicer accounts.

### Simulate authentication scenarios

While you're in development/testing against our sandbox environment, Nexus helps you simulate a few different user experience scenarios.

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> Remember that requests made in our Sandbox environment **do not** go through to the actual servicers, they return some form of dummy data. Only requests in production will go to a servicer. To use curated dummy data, check out our [guide to using data snapshots](/docs/data-snapshots).

`Nexus.link` asking a user to login.

#### Login _without_ challenge question (_default experience_)

It's possible to simulate authenticating (or re-authenticating) with a servicer and not being asked a challenge question. This is the default expectation for Nexus, so **any username and password value,** other than the special values detailed below, will result in this workflow.

#### Simulate a _failed_ login

It's possible to simulate the experience of a user entering invalid credentials for their servicer(s). You can test the error state with **one or both** of the following special credentials:

* username: `bad`
* password: `bad`

_You do not need to use both valuesâ€”sending either `bad` as the `username` **or** `password` value will result in failing to connect to a servicer._

#### Simulate login _with_ challenge question

It's possible to simulate the experience of authenticating with a servicer that asks the user to answer a challenge question. To do so, use the following special credentials:

* username: `challenge`
* password: _any password value will be accepted_

`Nexus.link` presenting a challenge question to authenticate an account.

#### Simulate a failed _challenge_

It's possible to simulate the experience of authenticating with a servicer that asks the user to answer a challenge question, and failing to answer the question correctly. To do so, use the following special credentials:

* username: `fail-challenge`
* password: _any password value will be accepted_

#### `Nexus.link` simulated authentication scenarios

| Username       | Password    | Experience                                                                          |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bad            | bad         | Login will not succeed. Only 1 input needs to have the value bad for login to fail. |
| challenge      | _any value_ | Login and asked a challenge question.                                               |
| fail-challenge | _any value_ | Login, asked a challenge question, and fail the challenge answer.                   |
| _any value_    | _any value_ | Login successfully without a challenge question.                                    |
