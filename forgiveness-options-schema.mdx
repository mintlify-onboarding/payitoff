There are many student loan forgiveness programs at federal, state, and lower levels available to borrowers. Our API surfaces two of the largest programs—PSLF and TCLI—and support for more forgiveness programs will continue to increase in the future.

When you query our [Get Forgiveness Options](/reference/get-forgiveness-options) API endpoint, you'll receive a JSON response with an `array` of [ForgivenessOption](/docs/forgiveness-option-schema) objects.
