> 🚧
> 
> Use [BorrowerPayload](/docs/borrower-payload-schema) for API `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests
> 
> For historical reasons, the request payload required when creating and updating a `Borrower` via our v1 API has a different shape than the response object. Thus, you must use a [BorrowerPayload](/docs/borrower-payload-schema) for your API request payloads, and expect a `Borrower` object as the response.
> 
> This discrepancy will be corrected in API v2.

> 📘
> 
> Always save the `Borrower.id` **and** `Borrower.uuid` to your systems
> 
> Borrowers have both an `id` and `uuid`. These are largely interchangeable in the API, and you'll see that our documentation and examples reflect passing `Borrower.id` in API calls. 
> 
> However, you should always save the `Borrower.uuid` value, as Nexus **requires** the `uuid` value, and **will not** work if supplied with a `Borrower.id` value.

> 👍
> 
> When you use [Nexus.link](/docs/nexus-link), we'll fill in data for you!
> 
> Normally, a `Borrower` returned from our API will only include the information you've provided when you create or update the `Borrower` record. However, when you use Nexus to link `Borrowers` and `Servicers`, we'll include the `first_name`, `last_name`, `address`, `phone`, and `email` we've collected from their `Servicers` when possible.
