---

When using our API to [Create Loans for a Borrower](/reference/create-loans), you can supply an `array` of `LoanPayload` objects.

The following are the minimum required properties to successfully create `Loans`:

* `interest_rate`
* `loan_type`
* `original_principal`
* `origination_date`
* `outstanding_interest`
* `outstanding_principal`
* `servicer_name`

> ðŸš§
> 
> Use `LoanPayload` for API `POST` requests
> 
> When creating `Loans` for `Borrowers` via the [Create Loans](/reference/create-loans) API endpoint, you must supply loan details in the shape of a `LoanPayload`.
> 
> You will receive a [Loan](/docs/loan-schema) object in the API response.
