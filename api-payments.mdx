## How Payments Work

Integrating Payments into your products and services requires a few different steps and careful attention to detail.

Let's take a quick look at the steps you'll want to follow to prepare a `Borrower` for having payment information ready and usable.

#### Use `Nexus` to link your Borrowers with their Servicers

To power payments, all Borrowers must be linked to their Servicers using [Nexus](/docs/nexus-link), our JavaScript widget which takes all the hassle out of connecting your Borrowers and building Loan Portfolios—and keeping them up-to-date.

#### Determine if you need a `Payment`, a `PaymentSeries`, or a `BatchPayment`
