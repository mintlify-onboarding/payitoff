description: "Payitoff API: LoansPayload Schema"
---

Whenever you create `Loan` objects for a `Borrower` using the [Create Loans](/reference/create-loans) API endpoint, you must supply a request payload. This payload is _always_ marked by a `loans` property. However, the value of that `loans` property may be one of two entities:

* an `array` of [LoanPayload](/docs/loan-request-schema) objects
* a single base64-encoded [LoansFilePayload](/docs/loans-file-payload-schema) value

| Property | Type   | Format                                   | Description                                        |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| loans    | string | byte                                     | base64-encoded MSD file as LoansFilePayload        |
| loans    | array  | [LoanPayload](/docs/loan-request-schema) | Array of LoanPayload objects with loan attributes. |

#### `LoanPayload` array example

When creating `Loan` objects via data collected from your `Borrower`, Plaid, or other source, the `loans` property value should be an `array` of [LoanPayload](/docs/loan-request-schema) objects with loan attributes directly:

LoanPayload Array

`{
  "loans": [
    {
      "loan_type": "Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loan",
      "interest_rate": 7.08,
      "outstanding_principal": 20000.00,
      "outstanding_interest": 0.0,
      "original_principal": 20000.00,
      "origination_date": "2019-09-22",
      "servicer_name": "Nelnet",
      "loan_status": "in repayment",
      "monthly_payment": 300,
      "repayment_plan_begin_date": "2020-05-11"
    },
    {
      "loan_type": "Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loan",
      "interest_rate": 7.08,
      "outstanding_principal": 20000,
      "outstanding_interest": 0.0,
      "original_principal": 20000.00,
      "origination_date": "2019-09-22",
      "loan_status": "in repayment",
      "monthly_payment": 300,
      "servicer_name": "Navient",
      "repayment_plan_begin_date": "2020-05-11"
    }
  ]
}
`

#### `LoansFilePayload` example

When creating `Loan` objects by uploading an MSD file, the `loans` property value should be a base64-encoded [LoansFilePayload](/docs/loans-file-payload-schema) of the MSD file itself:

LoansFilePayload

`{
  "loans": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAvwAAAUeCAYAAAACc..."
}
