A `BatchPayment` is an object representing the transfer of funds from a third-party, usually business-owned, `SourceAccount ` to many `PortfolioLoans` and/or `Servicer` accounts on behalf of many `Borrowers`.

#### Creating `BatchPayments`

Use the [Create BatchPayments](/reference/create-batch-payment) endpoint to create all `BatchPayment` records. When creating, you'll send a [BatchPaymentPayload](/docs/batch-payment-payload-schema) object, so be sure to check the guide to better understand how to successfully detail your batch and all associated payments.

> ❗️
> 
> Don't confuse `Payments`, `PaymentSeries`, and `BatchPayments`!
> 
> Our API supports making different kinds of payments on behalf of _one or more_ `Borrowers` from _their own_ bank accounts and from _third-party-owned bank accounts_.
> 
> The best way to determine if you should be creating a `Payment`, `PaymentSeries`, or `BatchPayment` is based on how many `Borrowers` you wish to make a payment for, and who owns the funding `SourceAccount`.

#### Do I need a `Payment`, a `PaymentSeries`, or a `BatchPayment`?
