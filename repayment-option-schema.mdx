title: "RepaymentOption"
description: "Payitoff API: RepaymentOption Schema"
---

A `RepaymentOption` object returns all the financial details of a given Repayment Plan, properly calculated for your `Borrower` and their unique situation, allowing you to provide a unique Assessment tailored just for their needsâ€”enabling them to compare various Repayment Plans against their current Repayment Plan, and choose a Plan that works best for their goals and needs.

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> Understand `total_paid` vs `total_cost`
> 
> **`total_paid`** is the sum of all monthly payments a borrower will make on a loan's current Repayment Plan over its lifetime.
> 
> With Income-Driven Repayment plans, there is sometimes a "tax bomb" at the end of their repayment termâ€”any outstanding balance is forgiven, but treated as taxable income. Thus, **`total_cost`** provides the sum of `total_paid` plus the taxes owed on that forgiven amount (which is calculated and provided in the `amount_forgiven` and `estimated_tax_liability` properties). In other words,`total_cost` is the bottom line amount a borrower will pay to dispense of their loan on a `RepaymentOption`.

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> Understand `scheduled_monthly_payment` vs `starting_monthly_payment`
> 
> When you look at `RepaymentOption` objects, you will notice there are two monthly payment propertiesâ€”`scheduled_monthly_payment` and `starting_monthly_payment`. Though confusing, these values are provided separately to help a borrower make the best financial decisions for their futures, not just during this historically anomalous time.
> 
> During the ongoing COVID forbearance periodâ€”currently scheduled to end 2023-06-30â€”**`scheduled_monthly_payment`** provides the monthly payment a borrower would pay _under normal conditions_.
> 
> On the other hand, **`starting_monthly_payment`** provides the monthly payment a borrower is expected to pay _during COVID forbearance_ (which should always be `0.00`).
> 
> When the COVID forbearance period ends, both `scheduled_monthly_payment` and `starting_monthly_payment` should hold identical values.
