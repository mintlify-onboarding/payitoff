Every `PortfolioLoan` in repayment is on a Repayment Plan. While many of our API request payload objects and responses indicate a `repayment_plan_type` as a short, helpful `string` representation of a `PortfolioLoan`'s current Repayment Plan, the `PortfolioRepaymentPlan ` object provides full details.
