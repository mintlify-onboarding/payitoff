When you want to create a `BatchPayment` to transmit funds from a [SourceAccount](/docs/source-account-schema) to many `PortfolioLoans` and/or `Servicers` on behalf of `Borrowers`, you will send a `BatchPaymentPayload` describing the payments you wish to make to our [Create BatchPayment](/reference/create-batch-payment) endpoint.

> 🚧
> 
> A few words about `reference_id` values
> 
> You will notice that you can supply a `reference_id` for [BatchPayment](/docs/batch-payment-schema) and [BatchPaymentItem](/docs/batch-payment-item-schema) objects when you create them via their relevant `Payload` objects. While these fields are not _required_, **we highly recommend always providing a _unique_ value for each `reference_id` property in your API request payloads.** Providing a UUID is an easy way to ensure you always have unique `reference_id` values for your `BatchPayment` and `BatchPaymentItem` objects.

> Your `reference_id` values should be a unique identifier created and stored in _your_ application to identify this `BatchPayment` for _your_ system. 
> 
> We will use the `reference_id`, when available, to ensure idempotency across [Create BatchPayment](/reference/create-batch-payment) requests (ensuring you always get the same `BatchPayment` outcome even if you resubmit the same request).
> 
> We will associate the `reference_id` of an item in your `BatchPaymentPayload` (and its `BatchPaymentItemPayload` objects in the `payments` array) if the [Create BatchPayments](/reference/create-batch-payment) request fails—allowing you to identify the offending item in your payload that did not pass validation.
> 
> The `reference_id` can be used to ensure you are able to match _your_ platform's internal representation of a `BatchPayment` with its Payitoff `BatchPayment` record.
> 
> The `reference_id` can help facilitate auditing your `BatchPayment` requests between your internal systems and the Payitoff API fulfilling `BatchPayment` requests.
> 
> The `reference_id` is a string field that allows any value, to provide maximum flexibility to provide your own identification scheme.

#### Examples

A valid `BatchPaymentPayload` should appear as the JSON value of a `batch` key in your request.

In the example below, you can see a **valid** `BatchPaymentPayload`:

* `total_amount` matches the sum of each `amount` property in the `payments` array
* `number_of_payments` matches the number of items in the `payments` array

Valid BatchPaymentPayload

`{
  "batch": {
    "total_amount": "325.46",
    "number_of_payments": 2,
    "source_account_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
    "reference_id": "b123",
    "payments": [
      {
        "amount": "150.12",
        "allocation": {
          "type": "servicer",
          "id": "9a57055f-ae0d-4ff1-b4b8-db4e564c27d6"
        },
        "reference_id": "b123-1"
      },
      {
        "amount": "175.34",
        "allocation": {
          "type": "loan",
          "id": "9a57055f-ae0d-4ff1-b4b8-db4e564c27d6"
        },
        "reference_id": "b123-2"
      }
    ]
  }
}
`

In the example below, you can see an **invalid** `BatchPaymentPayload`:

* `total_amount` _does not_ match the sum of each `amount` property in the `payments` array
* `number_of_payments` _does not_ match the number of items in the `payments` array

Invalid BatchPaymentPayload
