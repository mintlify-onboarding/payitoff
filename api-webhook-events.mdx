## Supported Events

The following are the events you can receive, process, and react to in your applications via [Payitoff Webhooks](/docs/api-webhooks).

Event notifications delivered via Webhooks will provide the same shaped JSON payload containing `event_type` and `data` keys. All event types follow an `object.event` pattern, and where relevant, return a JSON representation of the `object` which experienced the `event`, with updated `data` reflecting the state of the `object` after the `event`â€”the shape of this `object` will match the documented shape in its relevant schema. Some events, such as the `test` event type, return `null` as their `data`.

**NOTE:** _In the JSON samples below, the `data` object includes the Schema of the data that will be returned. Each event description should include a link to the relevant schema._

### `borrower.delinquent`

An event that occurs when a [Borrower](/docs/borrower-schema) is detected to have entered delinquency status at a [Servicer](/docs/servicer-schema).

JSON

  "event_type": "borrower.delinquent",
  "data": {
    "borrower": Borrower,
    "servicer": Servicer
  }

### `connectivity.interrupted`

An event that occurs when the account-syncing connectivity between a [Borrower](/docs/borrower-schema) and a [Servicer](/docs/servicer-schema) has been interrupted (_e.g._, because credentials have changed). The event notification will provide `Borrower.uuid` and `Servicer.id` values.

JSON

`{ 
  "event_type": "connectivity.interrupted",
  "data": {
    "borrower_id": "29847388-7220-40a2-8596-2732ce167a34",

---

### `connectivity.restored`

An event that occurs when the account-syncing connectivity between a [Borrower](/docs/borrower-schema) and a [Servicer](/docs/servicer-schema) has been restored (_e.g._, because user has re-authenticated). The event notification will provide `Borrower.uuid` and `Servicer.id` values.

JSON

`{ 
  "event_type": "connectivity.restored",
  "data": {
    "borrower_id": "29847388-7220-40a2-8596-2732ce167a34",
