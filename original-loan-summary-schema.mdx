> Understand `total_paid` vs `total_cost`
> 
> **`total_paid`** is the sum of all monthly payments a borrower will make on a loan's current Repayment Plan over its lifetime.
> 
> With Income-Driven Repayment plans, there is sometimes a "tax bomb" at the end of their repayment termâ€”any outstanding balance is forgiven, but treated as taxable income. Thus, **`total_cost`** provides the sum of `total_paid` plus the taxes owed on that forgiven amount (which is calculated and provided in the `amount_forgiven` and `estimated_tax_liability` properties). In other words,`total_cost` is the bottom line amount a borrower will pay to dispense of their loan on its current Repayment Plan.
