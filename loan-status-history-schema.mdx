`Loan` objects change status over timeâ€”they can move in and out of repayment, deferment, forbearance, and more.

The `LoanStatusHistory` object provides a view on the status changes a `Loan` has encountered over time, returning those status changes as an object of key-value pairs, in which the status event is the `value` and the date on which the status event occurred is the `key`:
