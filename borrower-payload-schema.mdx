> Use `BorrowerPayload` for API `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests
> 
> For historical reasons, the request payload required when creating and updating a `Borrower` via our v1 API has a different shape than the response object. Thus, you must use a `BorrowerPayload` for your API request payloads, and expect a [Borrower](/docs/borrower-schema) as the response.
