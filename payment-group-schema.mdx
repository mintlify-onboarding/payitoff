A `PaymentGroup` is a collection into which some Servicers organize borrower Loans. These groups are _very_ Servicer-specific. Some Servicers will group loans by loan type, others by federal student loan programs, and still others by a combination of factors like type, interest rate, disbursements, and more.

> A `PaymentGroup` often provides the most accurate data for highly important propertiesâ€”such as monthly payment, past due amounts, fees, transaction amounts, and more. Take particular note of the `monthly_payment.estimated` valueâ€”when `true`, this means Payitoff has determined the exact dollar amount of a group-level monthly payment, from which loan-level monthly payments will be calculated to be as accurate as possible, even when a Servicer doesn't directly expose loan-level payment info.
