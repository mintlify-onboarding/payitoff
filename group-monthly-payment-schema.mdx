| estimated          | boolean        | Indicates if the scheduled\_amount shown is a calculated estimate or confirmed as the exact dollar amount expected by the servicer.**NOTE:** Every servicer calculates and exposes a borrower's monthly payment in different ways. Payitoff uses a variety of intelligent heuristics to provide the most accurate scheduled\_amount. When we are able to confirm the monthly payment is correct _to the cent_, estimated will be false. Otherwise, estimated will be true. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
