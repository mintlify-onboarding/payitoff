Errors can occur for many reasonsâ€”forgetting authorization headers, omitting required parameters to certain endpoints, malformed URLs, etc.

All API Errors should return an appropriate HTTP status code to indicate the type of error encountered, and additional details provided in an response body of the following shape:

| Property | Type   | Any of                                           |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| error    | object | [AuthorizationError](/docs/authorization-errors) |
