description: "Payitoff API: IncomeCertification Schema"
---

We currently support uploading only a _single_ `IncomeCertification` at a time. If multiple `IncomeCertifications` are uploaded over subsequent requests, we will only use the _most recent_ `IncomeCertification` for Assessment operations and `Borrower` responses.

We want to support a future use case where multiple `IncomeCertifications` may be uploaded and a subset of those documents chosen by a `Borrower` as the documentation to submit with their IDR Enrollment Request. To avoid changes to the API in the future, this is why a `Borrower` response provides the `income_certifications` property as an array.

> ðŸš§
> 
> Use [IncomeCertificationPayload](/docs/income-certification-payload-schema) for API `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests
> 
> When creating and updating a `Borrower` with supporting Income Certification document(s), you must use an [IncomeCertificationPayload](/docs/income-certification-payload-schema) as your payload in the _singular_ `income_certification` property of a [BorrowerPayload](/docs/borrower-payload-schema) payload.
> 
> When a `Borrower` is returned by the API, the `Borrower` object will hold a _plural_ `income_certifications` property with `IncomeCertification`(s) within.
