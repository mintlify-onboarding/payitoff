A `Payment` is an object that describes a single transfer of funds to a `Servicer` from a `Borrower`\-owned `SourceAccount` on a specific date.

You can [create](/reference/create-payment), [edit](/reference/edit-payment), [list](/reference/list-payments), and [cancel](/reference/cancel-payment) a `Payment`.

#### Creating and Editing a `Payment`

Use the [Create Payment](/reference/create-payment) endpoint to create all `Payment` records. When creating, you'll send a [PaymentPayload](/docs/payment-payload-schema) object as your request body, so be sure to check the guide to better understand how to successfully define your `Payment`.

Use the [Edit Payment](/reference/edit-payment) endpoint to edit existing `Payment` records. Just as when creating, you'll provide a [PaymentPayload](/docs/payment-payload-schema) as your request body.

> ❗️
> 
> Don't confuse `Payments`, `PaymentSeries`, and `BatchPayments`!
> 
> Our API supports making different kinds of payments on behalf of _one or more_ `Borrowers` from _their own_ bank accounts and from _third-party-owned bank accounts_.
> 
> The best way to determine if you should be creating a `Payment`, `PaymentSeries`, or `BatchPayment` is based on how many `Borrowers` you wish to make a payment for, and who owns the funding `SourceAccount`.

#### Do I need a `Payment`, a `PaymentSeries`, or a `BatchPayment`?
