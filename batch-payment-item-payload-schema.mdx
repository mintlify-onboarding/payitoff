description: "Payitoff API: BatchPaymentItemPayload Schema"
---

When you [Create BatchPayments](/reference/create-batch-payment), you must provide a `payments` array as part of your [BatchPaymentPayload](/docs/batch-payment-payload-schema). The `BatchPaymentPayload.payments` array is populated with `BatchPaymentItemPayload` objects, which define the how you want your funds to be allocated.

#### Schema Definition

Properties in **bold** are required.

| Property         | Type   | Format                                                                                                                                                                                                | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **allocation**   | object | [BatchPaymentAllocation](/docs/batch-payment-allocation-schema)                                                                                                                                       | Identifies if a BatchPaymentItem is allocated to a Servicer or a specific PortfolioLoan. |
| **amount**       | string | decimal                                                                                                                                                                                               | The amount to pay to the defined allocation.                                             |
| **borrower\_id** | string | uuid                                                                                                                                                                                                  | A UUID identifying the Borrower on behalf of whom this BatchPaymentItem is allocated.    |
| reference\_id    | string | An arbitrary string that _must be unique_ for each batch._Not required, but highly recommended._NOTE: This reference\_id **must not** be the same value as the one you provided for the BatchPayment. |                                                                                          |

> A few words about `reference_id` values
> 
> You will notice that you can supply a `reference_id` for [BatchPayment](/docs/batch-payment-schema) and [BatchPaymentItem](/docs/batch-payment-item-schema) objects when you create them via their relevant `Payload` objects. While these fields are not _required_, **we highly recommend always providing a _unique_ value for each `reference_id` property in your API request payloads.** Providing a UUID is an easy way to ensure you always have unique `reference_id` values for your `BatchPayment` and `BatchPaymentItem` objects.

> 
> Your `reference_id` values should be a unique identifier created and stored in _your_ application to identify this `BatchPaymentItem` for _your_ system. 
> 
> We will use the `reference_id`, when available, to ensure idempotency across [Create BatchPayment](/reference/create-batch-payment) requests (ensuring you always get the same `BatchPayment` outcome even if you resubmit the same request).
> 
> We will associate the `reference_id` of an item in your `BatchPaymentItemPayload` if the [Create BatchPayments](/reference/create-batch-payment) request failsâ€”allowing you to identify the offending item in your payload that did not pass validation.
> 
> The `reference_id` can be used to ensure you are able to match _your_ platform's internal representation of a `BatchPaymentItem` with its Payitoff `BatchPaymentItem` record.
> 
> The `reference_id` can help facilitate auditing your `BatchPayment` requests between your internal systems and the Payitoff API fulfilling `BatchPayment` requests.
> 
> The `reference_id` is a string field that allows any value, to provide maximum flexibility to provide your own identification scheme.
